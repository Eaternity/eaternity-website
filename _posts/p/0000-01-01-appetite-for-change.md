				Together we strive for the adoption of climate friendly meals at the most important restaurants and conference centers. Further we will motivate the participation of any interested person in sharing and cooking provided climate friendly recipes to raise general awareness on greenhouse gas emissions related to foods.

      The basic idea is: We give FREE access to our Menu CO2 Calculator Software (the <a href="/app">Eaternity App</a>). So everyone can do precise measurements of the carbon footprint of the meals around the COP21 climate conference in Paris (and beyond).</p>

        <h3>Why are we doing this and what is our goal?</h3>

        <p>The goal is to jointly gain public attention and relevant media coverage on how significantly food contributes to climate change - AND how it has great potential as an agent for change:</p>

        <p>With <strong>31% of all greenhouse gas emissions originating from our food consumption</strong>, a reduction by half is possible and has a significant impact. Potentially <strong>saving 5.6 Giga tons of CO₂eq</strong> worldwide per year already; an impressive figure!</p>


      </div><div class="col-xs-12  col-sm-5  mobile-text-center">
        <h3>This is a special step for us.</h3>

        <p>Over the last 7 years, we have gained the <a href="/app/clients">reputation</a> and the <a href="/foodprint/database/#reference">scientific knowledge</a> (through our work in Switzerland), which make us confident, that what we are doing truly works.<br>
        Still, things do not progress fast enough to save our climate. In order to accelerate this process, we have made our decision to set our <a href="/about/media/#commons">assets free</a> - allowing everyone to use our software and create a movement on its own. This took some guts (in our whole team), but we are certain: this is just the right thing to do!</p>
