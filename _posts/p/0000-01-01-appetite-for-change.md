				Our food choices are responsible for 31% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. This accounts for more than 2.7 tons of CO₂ per person per year in US and Europe. We have the potential to reduce them by at least 50%. This will reduce more carbon emissions than any technological advancement ever will. Let us all work together to have restaurants and main conference centers serve climate friendly meals during COP21.</p>
        <h3>You are part of the solution.</h3> <p class="teaserText">Have an impact by cooking and sharing climate friendly recipes. And talk about it. Spread the word to raise general awareness on greenhouse gas emissions related to foods.

        <h3>Why are we doing this and what is our goal?</h3>

        <p>The goal is to jointly gain public attention and relevant media coverage on how significantly food contributes to climate change - AND how it has great potential as an agent for change:</p>

        <p>With <strong>31% of all greenhouse gas emissions originating from our food consumption</strong>, a reduction by half is possible and has a significant impact. Potentially <strong>saving 5.6 Giga tons of CO₂eq</strong> worldwide per year already; an impressive figure!</p>


      </div><div class="col-xs-12  col-sm-5  mobile-text-center">
        <h3>This is a special step for us.</h3>

        <p>Over the last 7 years, we have gained the <a href="/app/clients">reputation</a>, the <a href="/foodprint/database/#reference">scientific knowledge</a> and have triggered behaviourial change, which make us confident, that what we are doing truly works.<br>
        Still, things do not progress fast enough to save our climate. In order to accelerate this process, we have made our decision to set our <a href="/about/media/#commons">assets free</a> - allowing everyone to use our software and create a movement on its own. This took some guts (in our whole team), but we are certain: this is just the right thing to do!</p>
