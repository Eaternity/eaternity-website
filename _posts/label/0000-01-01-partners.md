    <p>We are not alone when it comes to the challenge of a sustainable food future. There are many great people and organizations that have put their trust in society and worked with us to build a unique and scalable solution. Without their support we wouldn’t be where we are.</p>

    <p>We are not a charitable organization. We believe in the power of business. Business can and should be a force for good. We are not driven to generate maximum profit at all costs, but to generate maximum impact on society by being profitable. We strongly believe in the transformative and catalytic power of a socially-focused business. Some call it "Benefit Corporation", "Social Entrepreneurship", or being a "Change Maker". We think of it as running a business that aims to create benefits for the whole of society instead of a privileged few. This is ambitious but we are confident that together we can achieve great things. We think collaboration is the key to maximizing impact. Let’s discuss how we can do this together. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a>, we’d love to hear from you.</p>

      <h3>Veganz</h3>
      <p>Veganz is our first project with the Eaternity Score. Together we have co-developed the initial launch of a new era for Eaternity. Veganz has put together an impressive program to make their sustainability focus heard. We are especially happy about their first choice of delicious products that kick-off this project.</p>

      <p>Veganz views sustainable handling of their resources as part of their corporate responsibility and are committed to exploring new strategies in reducing CO₂ emissions that surpass all regulatory requirements. Jan Bredack, Founder and CEO, explains why Eaternity’s solution makes sense from a business and ethical perspective: “Sustainability and CO₂ emissions are a regular part of what our consumers want. In working with Eaternity, we hope to offer additional value to existing and prospective consumers and consequently to contribute to avoiding CO₂ emissions.”
