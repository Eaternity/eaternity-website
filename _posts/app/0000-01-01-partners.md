      <p>We have the pleasure to work together with a number of great organisations to establish climate-friendly meals in society. What we are doing together is not business as usual. Everyone of our references is a pioneer of its own. It is our ambition to reach further out to significant numbers of restaurants. We want to truly make a difference. A positive difference on how our society organises and lives together.</p>

      <p>This is where it begins. Each of us can join. And together we will add up to the big picture, that will be part of the future we want to live in. – Thank you!

    <h3>VOGLHAUS in Konstanz</h3>
    <p>"We save the world with delicious food!" is the slogan of the VOGLHAUS in Constance. The dedicated team works with great fun to offer our guests tasty vegan - vegetarian organic cuisine, coffee and tea specialties and cakes at the highest level without raised forefinger. All cakes, salads, soups and dishes are freshly prepared in the in-house kitchen on the 1st floor.</p>

    <p>If you want to know, you can also find out about the CO₂ footprint of the dishes. Eaternity creates monthly reviews for DAS VOGLHAUS for the dishes and cakes.</p>

    <p>The latest highlight is a "SoLawi - dish", cooked according to the available vegetables, which should sensitize the guests to the fact that seasonality and regionality are just as important as organic farming and the support of smaller producers as the most extensive renunciation of animal ingredients in the fight against climate change. DAS VOGLHAUS obtains the vegetables for the dish through its shares in "SoLawi Konstanz e.V.".

    <h3>Dussmann Group</h3>
    <p>Dussmann runs its impressive restaurants now with the CO₂ values on screen. This is our first project together with the great <a href="https://www.procaremanagement.de/software/">Procare Management</a> Software.</p>

    <p>Dussmann have made adjustments in 20 Dussmann staff restaurants - from food purchasing to food service -  to reduce the CO₂ emissions of the mealplan. You can find out how environmentally friendly a meal is by the cloud icon on the meal plan. The more stars, the less CO₂ emissions and the smaller your environmental impact.”

      <h3>Apleona HSG Culinaress</h3>
      <p>Apleona is our first project together with <a href="http://www.eaternity.org/blog/delegate">Delegate</a> and <a href="http://www.qnips.com">QNIPS</a>. And they have put together an impressive program to communicate CO₂ measurements of meals and restaurant, for guests as well as for employee engagement. We are especially happy about their first clients that joined to kick-off the project.</p>

      <p>Apleona views sustainable handling of resources as part of their corporate responsibility and are committed to exploring new strategies in reducing CO₂ emissions that surpass all regulatory requirements. Armin Pilger, Head of Strategic Procurement, explains why Eaternity’s software makes sense from a business and ethical perspective: “Sustainability and CO₂ emissions are a regular part of the request for proposals in which we compete for new mandates. In connecting Delegate and Eaternity, we hope to offer additional value to existing and prospective clients and consequently to contribute to avoiding CO₂ emissions.”

      <h3>Compass Group (Switzerland) AG</h3>
      <p>In partnership with Compass Group (Switzerland) AG we are rolling out the Eaternity to 200 Compass restaurants. Their chefs can now see the difference it makes to a meal to switch from aubergine to courgette and how their restaurant’s climate footprint performs in comparison to all the others.</p>

      <h3>Federal Office for the Environment FOEN</h3>
      <p>The idea to improve sustainability in FOEN’s staff restaurant was driven from within the company. A group of employees sought discussions with the caterer, Compass Group (Switzerland) AG, asking for measures to improve the sustainability rating of the restaurant. Andreas Hauser, the initiative leader, argues: “We should somewhat live what we preach”. Since March 2015, Compass Group uses Eaternity’s software at the FOEN staff restaurant and serve various climate-friendly menus per week with the goal to reduce CO₂ emissions by 20% until 2020. Andreas Hauser emphasizes: “We do not mean to limit the [menu] choices but want to raise awareness that everybody has meaningful lever in everyday life to accomplish something.”

      <h3>City of Zurich serves Menu Plus</h3>
      <p>Truly pioneering. Since 2011 the municipality of Zurich serves Menu Plus in all their employee restaurants giving them the choice to eat climate-friendly on a daily basis. This was implemented after a successful 11 week pilot project that was supported by the campaign "good for me, good for our climate" bringing the restaurant guests one step closer to reach the "2000-watt-society".<br />
      Learn more at <a href="http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/menu-plus">www.stadt-zuerich.ch/menu-plus</a></p>

      <p>With an impressive case study financed by the "Energieforschung Zürich" the project did make a great leap in 2017. 6 Restaurants competed against each others in reducing CO₂ emissions by serving Menu Plus. And the results are truly impressing. On average they reduced 19%. The winner had to use some magic - he reduced even 42%. Everything, while guest satisfaction went up.

      <h3>Restaurant Coalmine</h3>
      <p>Restaurant Coalmine is a small bistro in Winterthur. With limited resources and a regular customer base, Colamine’s restaurant owner initially thought there was limited scope for researching and introducing sustainable food choices. But with Eaternity their recipes were analysed quickly. By adjusting some ingredients and replacing two meals on the existing menu, carbon emissions were immediately reduced by 20%. Climate-friendly meals are now highlighted on Coalmine’s menu card.<br />
