      <p>We prepare you for allergens compliance regulations enabling you to concentrate on your core business. The new food labelling EU-regulation 1169/2011 for allergens became effective on 13.12.2014 and requires gastro-businesses in all 28 EU-countries to display ingredient information relating to the fourteen main allergens. Our automated and rapid analysis of the ingredients used in your restaurant’s meals reduces your workload. We bring the information you need on a daily basis to your fingertips. Employees have easy access to meet the information requirements of every guest. They can also print comprehensive and customized meal labels with minimum effort. Declaring allergens properly is just the beginning. With Eaternity you can also manage and analyze all other nutritional information that interests you. We keep the data up-to-date and legally compliant so you don’t have to.</p>
