    <h3>Familie Wiesner Gastronomie</h3>
    <p>The goal of the Wiesner Gastronomie family is to continuously reduce its food-related CO₂ emissions and to completely offset them in the end. On the way to climate neutrality, the gastronomy group relies on various CO₂ reduction and compensation measures. The CO₂ calculation of their dishes with Eaternity is one of these measures.
    Thus, in the first years of using Eaternity, they were able to reduce their CO₂ footprint of the "Butcher" brand operations by more than 25% on average.
    Particularly climate-friendly dishes are identified in the "Nooch" and "Butcher" restaurants, for example. In this way, every person visiting them is given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want to choose climate-friendly offerings and compensate for the resulting CO₂ emissions.</p>

    <h3>Swiss Re</h3>
    <p>With the implementation of Eaternity Gastro from January 2021, Swiss Re has ignited the dialogue around climate-friendly nutrition as part of its "Our path to Net Zero Emissions" strategy. In the meantime, the environmental footprints of over 1,000 recipes have been calculated. The climate impact menu assessment has become an integral part of Swiss Re's employee restaurant menu communication. Swiss Re has already been able to reduce CO2 by an average of 28% in recent months (compared to before). These developments are an important basis for Swiss Re Gastronomy to take the next steps towards climate neutrality. Swiss Re is proud that its employees live the concept and are hungry for more.</p>

    <h3>Studentenwerk Erlangen-Nürnberg</h3>
    <p>The entire range of meals at the Langemarckplatz cafeteria are marked with a CO₂ label. This allows our guests to see at a glance which of the dishes are good for their own CO₂ footprint and were produced in a climate-friendly manner. This is made possible by linking the entire merchandise management system and menu planning with the service provided by Eaternity - where all ingredients are weighted according to their origin and production and are therefore always included in the calculation immediately.</p>

    <h3>VOGLHAUS in Konstanz</h3>
    <p>"We save the world with delicious food!" is the slogan of the VOGLHAUS in Constance. The dedicated team works with great fun to offer our guests tasty vegan - vegetarian organic cuisine, coffee and tea specialties and cakes at the highest level without raised forefinger. All cakes, salads, soups and dishes are freshly prepared in the in-house kitchen on the 1st floor.</p>

    <p>If you want to know, you can also find out about the CO₂ footprint of the dishes. Eaternity creates monthly reviews for DAS VOGLHAUS for the dishes and cakes.</p>

    <p>The latest highlight is a "SoLawi - dish", cooked according to the available vegetables, which should sensitize the guests to the fact that seasonality and regionality are just as important as organic farming and the support of smaller producers as the most extensive renunciation of animal ingredients in the fight against climate change. DAS VOGLHAUS obtains the vegetables for the dish through its shares in "SoLawi Konstanz e.V.".

    <p>WISAG stands for a high level of consulting expertise in catering, for individual catering concepts, far-reaching This applies to company catering as well as schools, kindergartens, hospitals, senior citizens' facilities and event catering.</p>

    <p>From modern zoodles and juicy cauliflower schnitzels to finely seasoned barley risotto, table guests at WISAG Catering's company restaurants can choose from a variety of climate-friendly dishes. All dishes offered during the campaign week each cause at least 50 percent less CO₂ than conventional meals. Using the App of the start-up Eaternity, the chefs at WISAG Catering calculated in advance how much CO₂ is emitted on average when preparing meals and sourcing ingredients. On the campaign days, for example, instead of a burger with a beef patty, they offer the more climate-friendly vegetarian alternative.</p>

      <p>Apleona views sustainable handling of resources as part of their corporate responsibility and are committed to exploring new strategies in reducing CO₂ emissions that surpass all regulatory requirements. Armin Pilger, Head of Strategic Procurement, explains why Eaternity’s software makes sense from a business and ethical perspective: “Sustainability and CO₂ emissions are a regular part of the request for proposals in which we compete for new mandates. In connecting Delegate and Eaternity, we hope to offer additional value to existing and prospective clients and consequently to contribute to avoiding CO₂ emissions.”

      <h3>Federal Office for the Environment FOEN</h3>
      <p>The idea to improve sustainability in FOEN’s staff restaurant was driven from within the company. A group of employees sought discussions with the caterer, Compass Group (Switzerland) AG, asking for measures to improve the sustainability rating of the restaurant. Andreas Hauser, the initiative leader, argues: “We should somewhat live what we preach”. Since March 2015, Compass Group uses Eaternity’s software at the FOEN staff restaurant and serve various climate-friendly menus per week with the goal to reduce CO₂ emissions by 20% until 2020. Andreas Hauser emphasizes: “We do not mean to limit the [menu] choices but want to raise awareness that everybody has meaningful lever in everyday life to accomplish something.”

      <p>Truly pioneering. Since 2011 the municipality of Zurich serves Menu Plus in all their employee restaurants giving them the choice to eat climate-friendly on a daily basis. This was implemented after a successful 11 week pilot project that was supported by the campaign "good for me, good for our climate" bringing the restaurant guests one step closer to reach the "2000-watt-society".<br />
      Learn more at <a href="http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/menu-plus">www.stadt-zuerich.ch/menu-plus</a></p>

      <p>With an impressive case study financed by the "Energieforschung Zürich" the project did make a great leap in 2017. 6 Restaurants competed against each others in reducing CO₂ emissions by serving Menu Plus. And the results are truly impressing. On average they reduced 19%. The winner had to use some magic - he reduced even 42%. Everything, while guest satisfaction went up.

      <p>Restaurant Coalmine is a small bistro in Winterthur. With limited resources and a regular customer base, Colamine’s restaurant owner initially thought there was limited scope for researching and introducing sustainable food choices. But with Eaternity their recipes were analysed quickly. By adjusting some ingredients and replacing two meals on the existing menu, carbon emissions were immediately reduced by 20%. Climate-friendly meals are now highlighted on Coalmine’s menu card.<br />
