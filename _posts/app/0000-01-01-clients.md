    <h3>Gesellschaft für Dienste im Alter - Gastronomie</h3>
    <p>Whether in administration or catering, in energy saving or climate protection: the concept of sustainability is a focus in all areas at GDA. For the GDA, ethics is also part of this, because it forms the basis - for conscious interaction with each other and for the conscious use of our resources. For this reason, all actions and activities at GDA are evaluated under the combined aspect of 'sustainability and ethics' and implemented in daily practice to the best of our knowledge and belief.</p>
    <p>
     Specifically in the gastronomic area, they are well on their way.

      We wanted to know and calculated the exact impact of their recipes and menus to determine our ecological footprint.

      The 2021 annual report shows: They produced 7 percent fewer CO2 emissions in their kitchens alone last year (2021) and are on the way taking a close look again this year. Click here for <a href="https://www.gda.de/fileadmin/user_upload/GDA/Redakteure/Bilder/UEber_die_GDA/Nachhaltigkeit/GDA_Nachhaltigkeit_Co2-Report_2021.pdf" >GDA's CO2 report</a>.

      With 7 percent less CO2 emissions, the GDA restaurants save as much carbon dioxide as is bound from the air by 20,000 oak trees in one month (177,000 kilograms of CO2). That's pretty good. Feel free to take a look at their <a href="https://www.gda.de/fileadmin/user_upload/GDA/Redakteure/Bilder/UEber_die_GDA/Nachhaltigkeit/GDA_NachhaltigkeitRestaurant_Co2-Zertifikat.pdf" >certificate for 2021</a>!

    <h3>Daimler Gastronomie</h3>
    <p>Daimler Gastronomie has been using our "Eaternity Gastro" service since December 2021: All self-operated canteens in Germany will successively report the ecological footprint of their menus in CO₂ equivalents. Our Eaternity database of life cycle analyses makes it possible to determine an exact footprint for each ingredient, for each combined product, for transport routes, the harvesting season, and other parameters. The values can then be incorporated into monthly inventory reports as well as real-time menu planning and individual recipes. This way, Eaternity creates the transparency needed to adjust measures and consistently pursue sustainability goals.</p>

    <h3>Rüsterei in Zürich</h3>
    <p>A responsible use of resources and a sustainable approach to food are very close to the heart of the restaurant in Zurich. In joint dialog with the team and in exchange with producers and guests, a collective understanding of enjoyment and culinary art was defined in order to anchor the communication of a new eating culture and attitude to life - with the goal of operating a CO₂ neutral restaurant.
    Since October 2021, Eaternity has been helping theüsterei to measure the environmental footprint of all its products. The restaurant thus gives its guests the opportunity to help shape their diet in a climate-friendly and sustainable way.</p>

    <h3>Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich</h3>
    <p>Sustainable catering at ETH Zurich: Based on scientific findings, a catalog of 17 criteria and goals supports the development of sustainable university catering. It includes aspects of climate protection, resource conservation as well as social, ethical and health aspects. With Eaternity as an ETH spin-off, ETH Zurich has a special place in our hearts. ETH has been working towards improving sustainability performance in its catering for some time and has collaborated with us on several occasions. Among them is the "Sustainable Gastronomy" project, which will come into effect in January 2022. The goal of the project is to make ETH gastronomy even more sustainable while maintaining transparency. Participation in the project is voluntary for the gastronomies. However, some criteria are a basic requirement for the project. In addition, there is a flexible set of criteria from which the restaurateur collects a minimum number of points.</p>

    <h3>Familie Wiesner Gastronomie</h3>
    <p>The goal of the Wiesner Gastronomie family is to continuously reduce its food-related CO₂ emissions and to completely offset them in the end. On the way to climate neutrality, the gastronomy group relies on various CO₂ reduction and compensation measures. The CO₂ calculation of their dishes with Eaternity is one of these measures.
    Thus, in the first years of using Eaternity, they were able to reduce their CO₂ footprint of the "Butcher" brand operations by more than 25% on average.
    Particularly climate-friendly dishes are identified in the "Nooch" and "Butcher" restaurants, for example. In this way, every person visiting them is given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want to choose climate-friendly offerings and compensate for the resulting CO₂ emissions.</p>

    <h3>Swiss Re</h3>
    <p>With the implementation of Eaternity Gastro from January 2021, Swiss Re has ignited the dialogue around climate-friendly nutrition as part of its "Our path to Net Zero Emissions" strategy. In the meantime, the environmental footprints of over 1,000 recipes have been calculated. The climate impact menu assessment has become an integral part of Swiss Re's employee restaurant menu communication. Swiss Re has already been able to reduce CO2 by an average of 28% in recent months (compared to before). These developments are an important basis for Swiss Re Gastronomy to take the next steps towards climate neutrality. Swiss Re is proud that its employees live the concept and are hungry for more.</p>

All cakes, salads, soups and dishes are freshly prepared in the in-house kitchen on the 1st floor.</p>

    <p>If you want to know, you can also find out about the CO₂ footprint of the dishes. Eaternity creates monthly reviews for DAS VOGLHAUS for the dishes and cakes.</p>

    <p>The latest highlight is a "SoLawi - dish", cooked according to the available vegetables, which should sensitize the guests to the fact that seasonality and regionality are just as important as organic farming and the support of smaller producers as the most extensive renunciation of animal ingredients in the fight against climate change. DAS VOGLHAUS obtains the vegetables for the dish through its shares in "SoLawi Konstanz e.V.".

    <p>From modern zoodles and juicy cauliflower schnitzels to finely seasoned barley risotto, table guests at WISAG Catering's company restaurants can choose from a variety of climate-friendly dishes. All dishes offered during the campaign week each cause at least 50 percent less CO₂ than conventional meals. Using the App of the start-up Eaternity, the chefs at WISAG Catering calculated in advance how much CO₂ is emitted on average when preparing meals and sourcing ingredients. On the campaign days, for example, instead of a burger with a beef patty, they offer the more climate-friendly vegetarian alternative.</p>

Andreas Hauser, the initiative leader, argues: “We should somewhat live what we preach”. Since March 2015, Compass Group uses Eaternity’s software at the FOEN staff restaurant and serve various climate-friendly menus per week with the goal to reduce CO₂ emissions by 20% until 2020.
