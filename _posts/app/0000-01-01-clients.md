      <p>We have the pleasure to work together with a number of great organizations to establish climate-friendly meals in society. What we are doing together is not business as usual, so every one of our references is a pioneer on its own. It is our ambition that we will reach further out to signficant numbers of restaurants. We want to truly make a difference. A positive difference on how our society organizes and lives together. 
		  
		  This is where it begins. Each of us can join. And together we will add up to the big picture, that will be part of the future we want to live in. – Thank you!

      <p>Restaurant Coalmine is a small bistro in Winterthur. With limited resources and a regular customer base Colamine’s restaurant owner initially thought there was limited scope for researching and introducing sustainable food choices. But with the Eaternity App their recipes were analyzed quickly. By adjusting some ingredients and replacing two meals on the existing menu carbon emissions were immediately reduced by 20%. Climate-friendly meals are now highlighted on Coalmine’s menu card.<br />
