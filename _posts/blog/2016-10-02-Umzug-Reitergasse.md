Eaternity moved! We said goodbye to our office in the [Wandellust][1] in district 7 and moved into our new office at [Reitergasse 11][2].
![Arrived at the Reitergasse office](/img/blog/2016-10-02-Umzug-Reitergasse/Reitergasse.jpg "Arrived at the Reitergasse office")
We are now as central as only a handful of other places in Zurich and within walking distance of Zurich's main station. With more space, first class infrastructure and office neighbours from Quantis, Swiss Cleantech and FFGS we found a perfect environment for more innovation for both private and professional kitchens.
