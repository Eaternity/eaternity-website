Together the software Delegate, Eaternity now enables every restaurant to have CO₂ transparency integrated in their existing business processes. Just worry about your menu-planning, we do the rest. Via a web service interface, Delegate receives the calculations of CO2 values of all recipes per business unit based on the ingredients, taking into account purchase behavior based on delivery notes. Moreover, Eaternity provides a monthly report for the business units. With 31% of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by our food, thus we can tap a great potential for climate protections.

The interface is now available with delegate version 11.20 as an optional license.

For further questions please contact Mr. [Christian Schmidt][1]  or Mr. [Manuel Klarmann][2].
