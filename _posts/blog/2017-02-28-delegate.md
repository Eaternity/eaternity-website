Together with [Delegate][0], we now enable every restaurant to have CO₂
transparency integrated in their existing business processes. Just worry about
your menu-planning, we do the rest. Via a web service interface, Delegate
receives the calculations of CO₂ values of all recipes per business unit based
on the ingredients, taking into account purchase behavior based on delivery
notes. Moreover, Eaternity provides a monthly report for the business units.
With 1/3 of greenhouse gas emissions caused by our food, we now tap into a great
potential for climate protection.

The interface is now available with delegate version 11.20 as an optional
license.

For further questions please contact Mr. [Christian Schmidt][1] or Mr. [Manuel
Klarmann][2].
