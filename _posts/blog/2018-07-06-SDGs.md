The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They were set by the United Nations in 2015 and agreed upon by 193 countries in the world.

Sustainable and healthy food underpins most SDGs, either directly or indirectly.

By promoting climate-friendly meals in society, Eaternity fully supports the implementation of the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals.

Helping restaurants and caterers to assess, manage and reduce their environmental impacts related to food, we especially aim at contributing to the achievement of the SDGs related to Good Health and Wellbeing (SDG3), Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG6), Sustainable Production and Consumption (SDG12), Climate Action (SDG13), Life Below Water (SDG14) and Life on Land (SDG15).
