<em style="font-weight: bold;">**Crowd-based reporting mechanisms replace costly
and corruptible auditors to ensure qualitative and quantitative Sustainable Fair
Trade without delays.**</em>

Fair Trade has been around for 70 years, linking consumers with an awareness for
fair wages to producers willing to respond to their demands. Today the concept
of Fair Trade is increasingly linked to a broader social and environmental
responsibility: Sustainable Fair Trade.

The common pitfalls for Fair Trade are the cost of uncorrupted verification of
standards and their chain of custody. With the rise of decentralized digital
network technology, first implemented in 2009 as a core component of the
crypto-currency Bitcoin, the barriers to Fair Trade have changed.

Commonly known as “blockchain” or “hashgraph”, a distributed ledger is a chain
of time-stamped, cryptographically secured, immutable blocks of
consensus-validated digital data, existing in multiple synchronized,
geographically distributed copies. Together, these properties make the data
practically impossible to tamper with.

The technology has grown to a level of sophistication and ease of use, so a
small group of people can use it to implement a simple idea and put it to a
test. The Distributed Ledger Technology offers so-called “smart contracts”:
self-executing digital contracts verified for authenticity.

### A Significantly Cheaper Marketplace

Consumers can agree on any requirement to their supply chain, be it a fair wage
policy climate-forcing emissions or any other consumer concern. By placing their
time-limited willingness to pay a prime for their demand on the digital
marketplace, their search for a verified supplier responding to their concern
begins. As a matter of facts, the consumer demands do not even need to be linked
to a certain product. The requirement may be seen as separately purchased
service. That way consumers choose their demands once and for all, be it food
products, leather goods or services. Their particular concerns are met across
the board of their purchases.

For verification, Distributed Ledger Technology replaces costly and corruptible
auditors by a crowd-based reporting mechanism, as already implemented in
prediction market schemes (see e.g., [www.augur.net][4]), where verification is
converted into a digital asset. Any attempt to influence the verification
outcomes can furthermore be revealed and intercepted by an economically
incentivized whistleblower function. This decentralized verification is
significantly cheaper than the physical audit scheme, which is currently in play
to verify the integrity of Fair Trade standards.

### Consumers are in Power

In order to meet the standard of the emerging prediction markets, the Fair Trade
verification model described above still needs to develop from a coarse global
reporting mechanism into a more granular community-controlled approach. But
first moving schemes for authentication of supply chains have already been
launched, e.g. by Everledger for diamonds, or more generally by
[www.provenance.org][3].

Decentralized network technology opens up an abundant field for enterprises that
are willing to assist consumers in changing the world through sustainable Fair
Trade.

In conclusion, consumers are not powerless and they don’t have to wait for
governments to agree on emission targets for CO₂ or fair wages. Furthermore
consumers do not need the authorities to enforce these agreements. New
decentralized network technology can place the consumers in control of the
supply chain, forcing businesses to act responsibly and sustainably.
