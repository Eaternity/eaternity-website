The Impact Journalism Day ([IJD][ijd], organized by [Sparknews][spark]) is a collaboration between international leading newspapers. On the same day, they publish supplements about creative and concrete solutions to global issues. 
On June 20, 2015, the third edition brought 45+ leading newspapers together, to publish 101 stories of hope and change, reaching 120 million readers.

Eaternity was part of this great initiative and we were featured in six newspapers in five countries in four languages (English, German, Italian and French). You can find the articles under the links listed below:

- [Tages-Anzeiger][1] (Switzerland)
- [The Huffington Post][2] (United States)
- [Luxemburger Wort][3] (Luxemburg)
- [Le Courrier de Russie][4] (Russia)
- [The Straits Times][5] (Singapore)
- [La Regione Ticino][6] (Switzerland)
