**Eaternity will take part at this year’s UN climate conference in Paris!**

With our **„App'etite for Change @ COP21“** campaign we would like to raise even
more awareness for the fact that almost one third of the CO₂ emissions is caused
by the food supply chain and the way we eat – and present solutions for how to
eat climate friendly and how to support a CO₂ emissions reduction actively.

Several scientific studies show that behavior, lifestyle and culture have a
considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions, with high
mitigation potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing
technological and structural change. Emissions can be substantially lowered
through changes in consumption patterns, adoption of energy savings measures,
dietary change and reduction in food wastes. Eaternity will help to get an
better understanding of our food’s influence on the climate change.

Besides **raising awareness**, we want to reach more well-known players to get
further support! With our knowledge in zero-food-waste menus we could help
restaurants, caterers and cooks in the whole world to reduce CO₂ emissions and
to become active climate saviors.

On 21. September 2014 more than 300’000 people went on the streets, in New York
alone - we build on this momentum.

Stay tuned what Eaternity’s activities at COP21 will look like! In the meantime,
you can find updates in our climate protestants [Facebook Group][facebook] and
