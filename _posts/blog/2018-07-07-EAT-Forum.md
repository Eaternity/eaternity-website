The 5th EAT Forum gathered in Stockholm leaders and practitioners from the whole world to call for a revolution of the global food system.

Eaternity participated in the Side Event “Meat of the Matter: Institutional Strategies for Climate-friendly food purchasing”, organized by Friends of the Earth and held on June 11. We presented our brand new Web App and showed how the participants of the Restaurant Contest that we monitored in Zurich could reduce the CO₂ emissions from food of 19% on average ([more details available here][1]).

The session highlighted the need to make the business case for better animal products, the potential for industries and trade groups to start addressing these challenges, as well as financial incentives and subsidies for healthier and more sustainable food products.

We believe that managing the environmental impacts of foodservice providers and restaurants represents a concrete tool to improve environmental protection as well as public health.
