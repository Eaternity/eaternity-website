„The software application which automatically assesses information about carbon emission and nutrition is the unique selling proposition of Eaternity AG. This future-oriented and innovate business model is perfectly consistent with the goals of the Technology Fund”, adds Simone Riedel Riley, General Manager of the Technology Fund.
