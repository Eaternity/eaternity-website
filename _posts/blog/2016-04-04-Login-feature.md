# Logging in to Eaternity

In Eaternity, to log in, you can always start by clicking the _CO2 Calculator_ button at the top right of [eaternity.org](http://www.eaternity.org).

If you're already logged in, you'll be taken straight to your account! If you're not currently logged in, you'll be asked for your email address.

** A few things to keep in mind: **

* Emailed log-in links expire after 15 minutes. If you waited too long, just enter your email again.
* There is no password. The log-in link is safe and only you have access to your email account, and thus to Eaternity.
* Don't forward this to anyone else! Doing so could let them into your account.
