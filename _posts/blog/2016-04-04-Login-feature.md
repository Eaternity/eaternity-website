#Logging in to Eaternity

In Eaternity, to log in, you can always start by clicking the _Log in_ button at the top right of [eaternity.org](http://www.eaternity.org).


![Sign In at Eaternity.org](/img/blog/2016-04-04-Login-Feature/nav-bar.jpg "Sign In at Eaternity.org")

If you're already logged in, you'll be taken straight to your account! If you're not currently logged in, you'll be asked for your email address.

**A few things to keep in mind:**

* Emailed log-in links expire after 15 minutes. If you waited too long, just enter your email again.
* There is no password. The log-in link is safe and only you have access to your email account, and thus to Eaternity.
* Emails are device-specific. So if you start logging in on your laptop, the email link won't work on your phone.
* Don't forward this to anyone else! Doing so could let them into your account.
