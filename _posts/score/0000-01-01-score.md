      <h3>The Eaternity Score is built towards optimal affordability and accuracy. With the goal of an accelerated transformation of the food industry.</h3>

      <h3>Product Environmental Footprint (Eaternity License)</h3>
      <p>You receive a detailed scientific sustainability metric, based on your food data. With your products’ recipes, we show you how you are doing on your way to reducing your CO₂ emissions, your water footprint and whether you are certified for animal welfare, sustainable palm oil or soja. You can print the results of the calculations with the provided The Eaternity Score on your product. The complete transparent assessment is your tool for management and marketing insights. On your request, we can publicly display the results, so consumers can access the calculation reference by scanning the product's barcode.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-5 col-md-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1">
      <p>The calculations are based on the full lifecycle of the whole product composition. This includes the transports, seasonality, packaging as well as other important factors. With this, we provide full actionable transparency and comparability for smart consumer choices.
      Comparison and rating are not limited to product categories. The product is always compared with all other products on the market. Since we use a standard portion size for standardization, comparability is ensured at all times (<a href="https://eaternity.org/blog/Eaternity-Rating-Update">rating normalization</a>).</p>

      <h3>Your benefit:</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>+ Accurate CO₂‚ and environmental calculation for your product.</li>
      <li>+ The Eaternity Score for printing and communication on your product.</li>
      <li>+ Provision of calculation details for analysis and creation of optimized products.</li>
      <li>+ App listing for transparent consumer information (optional).</li>
