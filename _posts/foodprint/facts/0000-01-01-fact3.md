				<p>Imagine if everyone would do this! There is no technical solution that can have a greater impact and is as efficient. It does not only contribute to a better climate, but also to our health. Including more vegetables and a greater variety of starch and protein sources contributes to a more balanced diet.
Your personal impact, although relatively small is highly relevant. It supports a sustainable food production system that we need to achieve fairness, assure life quality and enough space for us and nature.

One person eating one climate-friendly meal avoids emissions equivalent to a 6.5km car drive. If the whole population of the European Union would eat climate-friendly 3 times per week we can save emissions that is similar to having 35 million less cars on the street. It is also equivalent to planting more than 2500 million trees that could cover the size of 3.5 million soccer fields.
