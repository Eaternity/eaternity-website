				<p>Eating climate-friendly benefits you and the planet.</p>

						<p>By eating climate-friendly you support positive change towards a sustainable and fair food production system. The climate impact is massive. One climate-friendly meal avoids emissions equivalent to a 6.5 km car drive. If everyone in Europe and the US would eat climate-friendly 3 times per week our impact is similar to taking 57 million cars of the street or planting 4374 million trees covering the size of 5.89 million soccer fields.</p>

					<p>There is no technical solution that can have a greater impact and is as efficient. The great about eating climate-friendly is: anyone can do it. And we can start right here, right now being part of a broader community.
