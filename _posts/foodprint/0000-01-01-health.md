      <h3 class="text-center">A sustainability standard for restaurants</h3>
      <p> 31% of greenhouse gases originate from the production and consumption of food. At the same time food related diseases like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are on the rise in most countries.</p>
      <p>Currently, different methods are used to identify healthy and nutritious meals. It's hard to work out which one is most appropriate.</p>
      <p>Together with scientific partners and stakeholders we investigate opportunities and strategies to apply health and sustainability standards. Through collaboration we aim for fruitful exchange, broad consensus and easy adaptability of health and climate recommendations in restaurants.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Systematic comparison of health concepts and approaches that are applied in research and by general health recommendations and labels.</li>
        <li>Meta-analysis of existing literature on the climate, the environmental and our health.</li>
        <li>Define the compatibility of different health approaches with climate goals by calculating the carbon and "health footprints" of 5000 meals.</li>
        <li>Strategic collaboration with experts and stakeholders to stimulate debate, improve methodology and foster exchange and consensus on how to combine health and climate recommendations.</li>
        <li>Develop user-friendly instruments for restaurants and the public, to optimize health and climate impact of their meals.</li>

      <h2>You are invited to participate</h2>
      <p>This is a multi-stakeholder project. Scientific partners, experts and stakeholders are invited to come on board to secure quality, stimulate debate and fruitful exchange. Possible involvements range from active collaboration and carrying out reviews, to participation in workshops, or merely being kept up-to-date. Our long-term vision is to build a knowledge consortium on food and, its related environmental and health impacts.</p>
