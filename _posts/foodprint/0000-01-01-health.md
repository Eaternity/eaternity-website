      <h3 class="text-center">A sustainability standard for restaurants</h3>
      <p>31% of greenhouse gases originate from the production and consumption of food. At the same time food related diseases like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are in many countries on the rise.</p>
      <p>Currently, different approaches and applications for healthy meals and nutrition are in use and it is hard to decide which one is best appropriate.</p>
      <p>Together with scientific partners and stakeholders we investigate opportunities and strategies to apply health and sustainability standards. Through collaboration we target for fruitful exchange, broad consensus and easy adaptability of health and climate recommendations in restaurants.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Systematic comparison of different health concepts and approaches as applied in research and by general health recommendations and labels.</li>
        <li>Meta-analysis of existing literature on climate, environmental and health impact.</li>
        <li>Define the compatibility of different health approaches with climate goals by calculating the carbon and different „health footprints“ of 5000 meals.</li>
        <li>Strategic collaboration with experts and stakeholders to stimulate debate, improve methodology and foster exchange and consensus on how to combine health and climate recommendations.</li>
        <li>Develop user-friendly instruments for restaurants and the public optimizing health and climate impact of meals and nutrition.</li>

      <h2>You are invited to participate</h2>
      <p>This is a multi-stakeholder project. To secure quality, stimulate debate and fruitful exchange scientific partners, experts and stakeholders are invited to come on board. Possible involvements reach from active collaboration on results and carrying out reviews to participation in workshops or merely being held up-to-date. Our long-term vision is to build a knowledge consortium on food and its related environmental and health impacts.</p>
