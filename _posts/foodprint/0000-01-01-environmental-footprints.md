	      <p>Globally, we have enough fresh water resources, but water is not evenly distributed. Today 663 million people in the world live without clean water. While food production triggers 70% of all our fresh water use, mainly for irrigation. Particular in regions where water is scarce this becomes problematic for humans and the environment, as we consuming their water through the products we purchase. To help everyone needs to reduce world wide dependency on scarce water by 50%. Displaying on a per product and per country basis the amount of scarce water, Eaternity enables optimizations and complete transparency on the issue in a useful way.

      <h3>Measuring the Water Footprint</h3>
      <p>
			The water scarcity footprint of a product depends on the amount of fresh water (surface- and groundwater, not including rainwater or water pollution) that is used for the product in that particular  region of production as well on the relative water scarcity of the same respective region. </p>

    		<p>The Eaternity Water Footprint sets apart in that it explicitly includes the water stress of a region as a weighing factor for the amount of fresh water used. Water stress depends on the amount of water consumed in that region (Corrected for that some of the withdrawn water is returned to the water shed, f.e. after use for cooling in electricity production) compared to the amount of water that is naturally provided by rainfall and other precipitation. Our datasets allow us to differentiate this water scarcity factor between 162 countries.</p>

    		<p>Globally, the water we consume comes from regions with an average water scarcity index of 0.51, which means that on average, we are consuming water under moderate to high water scarcity. However, the average person lives in an area with water scarcity of 0.32. This means that many products are transported from water scarce areas to areas with lower water scarcity.</p>

    		<p>For example, a tomato that is produced in Spain requires 44 times more irrigation water than in Switzerland. Because water in Spain is scarcer than in Switzerland, the scarcity footprint of an average Spanish tomato is 2400 times higher than an average Swiss tomato.</p>

          <p>
    			Depending on what food is consumed and where the food comes from, every country has a unique list of food products that are typically problematic and contribute most to the national water scarcity footprint. In Switzerland, the consumption of olives, nuts, chocolate, coffee, milk products, rice and beef contribute most to the Swiss national water scarcity footprint. It does not mean that we should avoid these products altogether, but that we should be more careful in their use and that it matters where these foods were produced. </p>
    			<p>Eaternity provides water scarcity footprint for a menu and its ingredients dependent on the fresh water footprint of the product in that region and the water scarcity of the region. The 5 drops display if the value is good compared to other menus.

			<p>Tropical forests store massive amounts of carbon and hold 2/3 of all land-based species even though they only cover 5% of the Earth’s land area. They provide us with fresh water and they affect local and global climate and weather patterns. The production of soy and palm oil, timber production and grazing cattle are the main driver of tropical rainforest deforestation and lead to a tremendous loss in biodiversity.

			<h3>Indicating forest protection</h3>
			<p>
				The Rainforest label is given to food products that did not cause deforestation. This is the case if the product contains certified soy or palm oil or if the product doesn’t contain palm oil or soy at all. In addition, uncertified soy is still fine if it stems from a non-critical country. For example, European soy is always a good option and receives the forest label as well. Since 75% of all soy is fed to animals, we also evaluate and label animal products by the type of soy they were fed with.

      <p>This fact sheet invites to create a common ground for climate action by summarizing current knowledge on the climate and environmental impacts of conventional and organic production.</p>

			<p>It is supported by our scientifc board of experts and partners. It was developed in 2017 as part of the Organic Footprint project which was made possible by the Engagement Fund Migros.</p>

			<p>The environmental indicators are the result of the Organic Footprint project. Our aim was to create a common ground for climate action by summarizing current knowledge on the climate and environmental impacts of conventional and organic production.  </p>

			<p>As a consequence, Eaternity included additional indicators for water scarcity, tropical deforestation and animal welfare into the Eaternity App to support the overall goal of reducing the food related climate impact.</p>

			<p>Together with our scientific partners at ZHAW and Quantis we investigated how the climate and environmental impacts of organic food differs from conventional food. At the Organic Footprint Workshop 2016 held in Zürich we discussed with scientists, chefs, consumers and farmers the state of the knowledge in sciences and which indicators are crucial to assess environmental sustainability of food. Based on those discussions and the scientific work conducted within this project we selected this core set of indicators. All main findings and conclusions are summarized in the Organic Fact Sheet and is broadly supported by experts and stakeholders. We express our deepest gratitude to the leading scientists in our advisory board that supported us throughout the project with valuable inputs and reviews.</p>

			<p>All results of the project were put into practice at the impuls event “Smart Chefs”. Chefs presented delicious appetizers and showed that tasty meals can be healthy and sustainable at the same time.</p>

			<p>We thank Migros Engagement Fund for funding the Organic Foodprint project from 1.5.2017 – 31.12.2017.</p>
